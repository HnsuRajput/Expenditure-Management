# Expenditure-Management
Introduction

An Expenditure Management System is a web-based application designed to help individuals and organizations efficiently track, manage, and control their financial expenses. This system provides a user-friendly interface for recording expenditures, categorizing them, and generating insightful reports to help users stay within their budgets and make informed financial decisions.

The system is built using HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity. HTML forms the backbone of the system, defining the layout and elements such as input fields, buttons, and tables. CSS enhances the visual appeal by providing a consistent look and feel, including colors, fonts, and responsive design to ensure the system works well on various devices. JavaScript adds interactivity, allowing users to perform actions like submitting forms, validating inputs, and dynamically updating the content without refreshing the page.

This system is ideal for personal use, small businesses, or any organization that needs to keep track of its expenses efficiently. By automating the process of managing expenditures, users can reduce manual effort, minimize errors, and gain better control over their finances.
